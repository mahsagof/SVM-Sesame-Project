A  system for estimation of Sesame Qualitative Properties Using Support Vector Machine
The quality of sesame is measured by its qualitative properties such as oil and protein. Estimation of these properties is not practical for everybody as it requires experts with special facilities. Obviously, germination and qualitative properties are related. In this paper, we study the relations to show how germination properties such as stem length and germination rate affect the qualitative ones. Therefore, we presented a nonlinear three-phase model to estimate the quality properties of the seeds.
This paper is at the final step and after publication, I will put the entire code. For now, I just have put the main code to show the process of the method.
